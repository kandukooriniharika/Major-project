Implement Health Insurance Cost Prediction using Ensemble Learning

- Conducted exploratory data analysis on demographic and health-related features
- Applied ensemble models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.) for cost prediction
- Evaluated model performance with metrics like R² and RMSE
- Analyzed key cost-driving factors such as age, BMI, smoking habits
- Incorporated insights from literature review to guide model selection

- Health insurance costs have risen dramatically over the past decade in response to the rising cost of health care services and are determined by a multitude of factors. Let's look at the cost of healthcare for a sample of the population given age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, and region. The purpose of this project is to determine the contributing factors and predict health insurance costs by performing exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling on the Health Insurance dataset. An important informatics tool for controlling healthcare costs is accurately predicting the likely future healthcare costs of individuals. To address this important need, we conducted a systematic literature review and identified ensemble methods for predicting healthcare costs. To enable a direct comparison of these different approaches, we empirically evaluated the predictive performance of each reported approach, as well as other state-of-the-art ensemble learning methods. 

Two metrics are described in this table RMSE and R2 score. Among all models with different combinations, whenever used combination of all models gives R2 score is 0.8810, this value nearer to 1, so it is considered more positive. RMSE value is 4297.4952, this value indicates a low error rate compared to the remaining models.
